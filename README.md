A Pomodoro-style productivity app where users can passively build skyscrapers by working through the timer. [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) is cool, but underwhelming in my opinion. A cooler reward can be a better incentive to get work done. Oh, skyscrapers are cool and they grow upwards, so let's use those.

Planned features:
- Task organization
    - Projects (cities) and tasks (skyscrapers)
- Different types of skyscrapers (rarity varies)
- Small social aspect for sharing skyscrapers with other users
